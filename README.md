Yak Razor: Scheduler for Yak Shavers

Do you find yourself starting a task,
only to find yourself on a side quest of a side quest that was 
a required diversion to complete the initial task?
But you've lost track of what prompted you 
to take up the side quest and now the original task
remains unfinished and you've moved on to something else.

Yup.


## Why Yakrazor?

- I get distracted or go off on a side quest too often and
  I forget how I got here and
  what was the last thing I was doing and
  the one before that...
- Some days I don't want to start with the most demanding task
- I feel overwhelmed with too many pending tasks
- I don't wake up at the same time every day and
  fixed reminders and calendar events don't work for me
- I forget to add todos for ad-hoc requests
- I have way too many things to get done and
  many of those things depend on someone else and
  I have to follow up, which I also forget
- I forget to use my todo app

If the constraints sound familiar, 
Yakrazor might help.
