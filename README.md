Yak Razor: Scheduler for Yak Shavers

Do you find yourself starting a task,
only to find yourself on a side quest of a side quest that was 
a required diversion to complete the initial task?

## Why Yakrazor?

- I get distracted or on a side quest too often and
  I forget how I got here and
  what was the last thing I was doing and
  the one before that...
- Some days I don't want to start with the most demanding task
- I feel overwhelmed with too many pending tasks
- I don't wake up at the same time every day and
  fixed reminders and calendar events don't work for me
- I have way too many things to get done and
  many of those things depend on someone else and
  I have to follow up, which I also forget
- I forget to add todos for ad-hoc requests
- I forget to use my todo app

If the constraints sound familiar, 
Yakrazor might help.
